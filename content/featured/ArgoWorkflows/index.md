[Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/) is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).  
It allows to - (i) Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container, (ii) Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and, (iii) Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
